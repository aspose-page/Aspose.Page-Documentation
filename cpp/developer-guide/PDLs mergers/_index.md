In this paragraph, you will find the description and code examples of merging PDLs files functionality. The information here is aimed to help you with integrating it into your own solution.

Merging functionality is actually similar and based on the conversion.  It is the process of taking a few files of one format, combining, and mixing them into a different format. When would you need such a solution?
- If you have a few documents and want to have their content in one file.
- When you want to share the documents with someone who does not have the proper software to open Page Description Language files.

Aspose.Page supports Portable Document Format, or as many of us know it, PDF format as an input format as it is the most popular and well-spread format. Almost every modern device, browser, or operational system has tools to open a PDF file.

The next mergers according to the supported input formats are available:

- [EPS files to PDF Merger](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/merge/eps/).
- [PostScript files to PDF Merger](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/merge/ps/).
- [XPS files to PDF Merger](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/merge/xps/).

To see an example of the app that uses these APIs try this [cross-platform application](https://products.aspose.app/page/merger).
