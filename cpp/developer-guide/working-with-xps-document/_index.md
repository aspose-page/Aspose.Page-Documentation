`XPS` extension is linked to the XML Paper Specification (XPS). The format is known as an open graphic format of the fixed based on XML layout.

XPS is a static Page description language as well as PDF. It uses vector inconsistent markup and supports multi stream work, encryption, and digital certificates. It does not support scripts so is considered to be safe.
