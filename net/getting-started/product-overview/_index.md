## **Product Description**
Aspose.Page is an API designed to work with XPS and EPS/PS documents. The API allows converting XPS and EPS/PS documents to PDF and Image file format. Moreover, API allows opening existing XPS documents, creating new ones and saving either to file or stream. As soon as a document (XpsDocument class) instance is created (existing document is opened or a new one is created), you can add (to the end of page list) or insert (at specified page list position) new or previously created pages, remove pages, select a page by number as “active”. Only the page that is selected as “active” can be edited. A page can be created without binding to the document. You can bind it any time you like. For newly created document instance the first page gets selected (if a new document is created then its first page is created either).

Aspose.Page for .NET is a Managed C# API and it can be used with any .NET language like C#, VB.NET and J# etc. Since it is .NET based API, you can use it in any .NET Application e.g. ASP.NET Web Applications, Winform Applications or Console Applications.

Like other products offered by Aspose, Aspose.Page for .NET comes with fully featured demos and working examples written in C#. In order to help developers and let them understand API quickly, all examples are hosted of [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-page/Aspose.Page-for-.NET) in a public repository.

Aspose.Page for .NET is robust and light-weight API which converts XPS and EPS/PS files into other file formats fast and efficiently.

Aspose.Page for .NET is multithread safe as long as only one thread works on a document at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one document. Different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.
