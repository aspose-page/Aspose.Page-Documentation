## **Evaluate Aspose.Page for .NET**
You can easily download Aspose.Page for .NET in order to evaluate the API. The evaluation download is the same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you add a few lines of code to [apply the license](/page/net/licensing/).

Unlicensed product allows converting of PostScript files which size is no more than 1KB and resulting PDF document in such cases will contain evaluation mark. Furthermore, it will allow manipulating no more than 4 XPS elements and resulting document or image in such cases will also contain evaluation mark.

If you want to test Aspose.Page for .NET without the evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day Temporary License. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)

## **Installing Aspose.Page for .NET through NuGet**
NuGet is a free, open-source developer-focused package management system for the .NET platform intent on simplifying the process of incorporating third party libraries into a .NET application during development. It is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework. A library or tool can easily be shared with other developers by creating a NuGet package and storing it inside a NuGet repository. When you install the package, NuGet copies files to your solution and automatically makes the necessary changes, such as adding references and changing your app.config or web.config files. If you decide to remove the library, NuGet removes files and reverses whatever changes it made to your project so that no clutter is left.
