`XPS` extension is linked to the XML Paper Specification (XPS). The format is known as an open graphic format of the fixed based on XML layout.

[XPS](https://docs.aspose.com/page/net/what-is-xps-file/) is a static Page description language as well as PDF. It uses vector inconsistent markup and supports multi stream work, encryption, and digital certificates. It does not support scripts so is considered to be safe.

XPS file is a ZIP archive that has next elemens: Fpages (pages of the file's document), document parts, and a folder with relationships of the pages. The trick here is that an XPS file can be viewed by changing its extension to `.zip` and using any archiver software available on your device.
