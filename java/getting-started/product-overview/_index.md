## **Product Description**
Aspose.Page is an API designed to work with XPS and EPS/PS documents. The API allows converting XPS and EPS/PS documents to PDF and Image file format. Moreover,  API allows opening existing XPS documents, creating new ones and saving either to file or stream. As soon as a document (XpsDocument class) instance is created (existing document is opened or a new one is created), you can add (to the end of page list) or insert (at specified page list position) new or previously created pages, remove pages, select a page by number as “active”. Only the page that is selected as “active” can be edited. A page can be created without binding to the document. You can bind it any time you like. For newly created document instance the first page gets selected (if a new document is created then its first page is created either).

Aspose.Page for Java can be used in Desktop GUI Applications, Web Applications and Console Applications etc. Like other products offered by Aspose, it comes with fully featured demos and working examples written in Java. In order to help developers and let them understand API quickly, all examples are hosted of [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-page/Aspose.Page-for-Java) in a public repository.

Aspose.Page for Java is robust and light-weight API which converts XPS and EPS/PS files into other file formats fast and efficiently. It is a multi-threaded safe, as long as only one thread works on a document at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one document. Different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.
